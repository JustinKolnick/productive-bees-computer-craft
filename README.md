# productive-bees-computer-craft
This repo contains scripts used on ATM9 for my bee base.
- computer craft
- tweaked cc
- advanced peripherals
- productive bees

## Installation
On your computer craft computer, run the following to download the install script.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustinKolnick/productive-bees-computer-craft/main/install.lua
```

Then run the install script to download the repository.
```
install
```

The repository will be placed in a directory called `pbcc`. This directory contains everything from this github repo, including bee hive data fetching and in-depth diplays with all relevant bee info from your colony!

There's a little bit of setup which I've covered in this video (todo).

## Support

If this was useful or you just want to support future projects like these, buy me a coffee! I drink a lot of it :)
